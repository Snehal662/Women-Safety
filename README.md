# Women-Safety
This project is a wearable womenâ€™s safety device embedded in jewellery, allowing discrete emergency alerts using a joystick trigger, LoRa communication, and GPS tracking.
It sends distress signals directly to a police station's Raspberry Pi, even without mobile networks or internet, ensuring faster rescue and safety in rural and isolated areas.
